Volunteers are essential to the mission of CAFCH.  Not only do they provide
much of the labor for construction and the money to purchase the necessary
supplies for that construction, they also make up a crucial component, along
with the homeowners and local CAFCH allies, of the "beloved community"
that CAFCH seeks to build and nurture.  Most of our volunteers have limited
experience with construction so they work under the watchful eye of CAFCH's
exceptional construction supervisor, Ben Williams.  Ben is an omnicompetent
jack of all trades when it comes to construction, and he is also a patient
and skilled teacher.  He excels at building volunteer's confidence in their
abilities to take on tasks amenable to their abilities and comfort levels
and he teaches them carefully, with an eye to safety as well as to quality.
For years, volunteers have come to trust Ben and to value his instruction
highly, and he plays a significant part of the community-building successes
of the affiliate.

Local volunteers are typically available for only short periods of time
(i.e Saturdays or holidays) so they usually finish projects that are near
completion or work on needed repairs of existing Fuller Center houses.
We make every effort to ground these volunteers in the sense of mission that
motivates the ministry, so that the connections they make on the worksite
can continue to grow in other areas of service throughout the community.

Out of town volunteers are the lifeblood of CAFCH.  The entire Delta region
has been recently identified by a University of Michigan study as an area
of "deep disadvantage," meaning that social justice issues here are more
involved than just sub-standard housing, though that is a critical component.
Poverty is ubiquitous in the Delta, educational opportunities have been
historically limited, and cooperation across racial, social class, and
geographic lines has been intermittent at best.  Many Deltans have "taken
up their cross" in recent years to address some of these issues, but they
acknowledge that outside help is always needed and appreciated and they are
quick to express their appreciation of it.  As a result, volunteer groups
often leave inspired by what they've experienced as they cooperate with
like-minded local folks on the worksite, at weekly potlucks, and in various
educational settings.

As vital as that work is, CAFCH's mission goes beyond construction and
repair of houses.  A unique part of CAFCH's offerings to volunteers, in
fact, comes outside the workplace for groups that want to take advantage of
such opportunities.  Half-day history tours of Coahoma County, recounting
stories that explain some of why the area is so impoverished as well as the
significant stories that highlight the efforts of Habitat/Fuller veterans
outside construction, are one option.  Real conversations with homeowners,
at the potluck and in evening sessions, about their experiences growing up
with Delta discrimination as well as the ways that life in Habitat/Fuller
homes has had a positive impact on their lives are another option.
More opportunities for learning and sharing occur through presentations
made by leaders of dynamic, Fuller-allied after school programs like Spring
Initiative and Griot.  In all of these offerings, CAFCH seeks to educate
volunteers about the dynamics behind the issues of substandard housing and
deep disadvantage, and often serves to inspire volunteers to return to Coahoma
County to be a part of that community-building.  As of 2020, thirty such out
of town volunteers have given at least a year of their lives in service to
the community, and the results are mutually beneficial for all.
