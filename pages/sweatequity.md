Sweat equity is a term the Fuller Center uses when talking about the
participation of future partners in the processes of house construction
and homeownership. It’s about doing the work — the hard work
— to bring an idea to life.  That work becomes an investment in the
project. It can be an investment as real as money or land.  According to
[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sweatequity.asp), an
online financial resource, sweat equity is the

>contribution to a project or enterprise in the form of effort and toil. Sweat
equity is the ownership interest, or increase in value, that is created as
a direct result of hard work by the owner(s). It is the preferred mode of
building equity for cash-strapped entrepreneurs in their start-up ventures,
since they may be unable to contribute much financial capital to their
enterprise.

At the Fuller Center, sweat equity is a new homeowner investing in their home
or one for another family. It’s not a form of payment, but an opportunity
to work alongside volunteers who give their time to bring to life a family’s
dream of owning a home.

Sweat equity can take many forms for partner families working with the Fuller
Center. It can mean construction work on their home or on a home for another
family, cleaning up the build site, assisting in administrative duties,
planning and participating in community potlucks, or countless other ways of
helping out. Homeowner classes — learning how to manage a home or finances
— also count as sweat equity. Families invest their time in the long-term
success of their homeownership. Throughout the process of purchasing their
home, Fuller Center partner families can earn sweat equity credit as they
learn about their mortgage, insurance, maintenance, safety and more.

The idea behind sweat equity, families working side by side with volunteers
to build their homes, goes back to even before Habitat for Humanity, the
parent organization of the Fuller Center, began in 1976. Clarence Jordan—
the founder of Koinonia Farm, near where the Fuller Center and Habitat for
Humanity have their home bases — wrote in a 1968 letter, "What the poor
need is not charity but capital, not case workers but co-workers." That
co-worker approach informs the Fuller Center’s emphasis on sweat equity:
all of us working together so that homeowners can achieve the strength,
stability and independence they need to build a better life for themselves
and for their families.
