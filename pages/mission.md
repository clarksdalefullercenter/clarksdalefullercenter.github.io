Seeking to put God’s love into action, Clarksdale Area Fuller Center
for Housing (formerly Clarksdale Area Habitat for Humanity) brings people
together across generational, geographic, racial, and social class boundaries
to build affordable homes, vibrant communities and transformational hope.

What has made CAFCH (and CAHFH before it) historically different than, say, any
government or privately funded program to provide low-income housing is this
motivational, spiritual notion of putting “God’s love into action”—the
Golden Rule, in other words. The idea is an amorphous proposition at best,
given the wide variety of beliefs about the existence of God, and it is as
bold as it is problematic. It presupposes, of course, the existence of a God
Who actually cares about Creation and the individuals living in it, especially
those who are struggling for one reason or another. Most obviously, CAFCH’s
preoccupation in this regard are those who find themselves in economically
difficult situations—the “poor”—whose circumstances are often caused
by dynamics beyond their control and whose plight is often ignored by the
world around them but not forgotten by this God. But the love of God, it turns
out, requires the cooperation of people in order to be fully manifested in
the world, and this notion of partnering—not just between God and humans,
but also among people themselves—is at the heart of the Fuller vision and
practice, even for those who do not share in this foundational proposition
about the genesis of this love.

We use the word “homes” to describe what we build rather than “houses”
because the former hopefully involves fostering life-giving relationships
beyond mere edifices. We certainly construct buildings, and solid ones at
that, but we hope and oftentimes observe that the creation of Fuller homes
brings advantages beyond housing, as significant as that is. Homeowners
experience a sense of dignity and self-worth, families report better school
performance from their children, and neighborhoods can reflect stability
and general improvement from the addition of Fuller homes.

The genius of Fuller, however, goes beyond the buildings themselves. Fuller
Center construction, dependent as it is on volunteer labor, brings together
people who would ordinarily never interact. Fuller workers cross social class,
racial, ethnic, and geographical boundaries in ways that create unexpected
connections, encourage new perspectives, and open eyes to realities foreign
to our normal experiences. In the process, disparate groups discover what
unites them rather than what separates them, and many come away from their
Fuller experiences with an appreciation for others that would simply otherwise
never take place. The result, at its best, is the creation of communities
bonded together by shared struggle and incarnated love. On occasion, these
community connections prove to be literally life-changing, as volunteers
and homeowners alike sometimes find direction and purpose well beyond the
construction process.

Finally, *hope* lies at the heart of the Fuller Center vision and program. As
it is all too obvious, partnering to build houses with those in need, as
dynamically transformational as it can be, does not necessarily end all
social ills. The roots of poverty for the materially poor run deep, as do,
for the materially privileged at times, manifestations of meaninglessness,
in systems that celebrate and reward only monetary gain, social celebrity,
and political power. Fuller provides an environment that directly challenges
those systems, and the results are oftentimes a sense of hopefulness that
transcends expectation, inspires further social justice activism, and provides
purpose and meaning to lives that lack both.

The Fuller vision is ambitious. It is a road map rather than a rule book,
and the reality does not always live up to the vision. The road is full of
potholes and we sometimes miss the directional signs. Fuller communities are
still made up of people, not angels, and the manifestations of self-worship all
too often rear their ugly heads when we neglect the foundational admonition
to love our neighbors as ourselves. But the vision is not merely theoretical
or rhetorical—it has been practiced, experimented with, experienced, built
upon, and borne good fruit, which is why CAFCH continues to exist and seeks
to attract the support of any inclined to participate. And, at its best,
it illustrates this idea of “God’s love in action,” as reflected in
the perspectives and promises of Isaiah 58.

>Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of
injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and
break every yoke?  Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to
provide the poor wanderer with shelter—when you see the naked, to clothe
them, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?  Then your light
will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then
your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be
your rear guard.  Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will
cry for help, and he will say: Here am I.  If you do away with the yoke of
oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk, and if you spend
yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed,
then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like
the noonday.  The Lord will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs
in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame.  You will be like
a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail.  Your people
will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you
will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.

This is the vision that motivates us to fulfill the mission we believe we
have been called to serve.
