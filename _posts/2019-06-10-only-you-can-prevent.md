While we await the arrival of two more groups from the beautiful parish of St. Francis Xavier parish, we (the royal we) feel compelled to ask for financial help again.  Now that the summer has arrived and the dreaded phenomenon known as “dweltering” (sweltering in the Delta heat) is upon us, a number of our homeowners have been reporting problems with their cooling units.  While we theoretically should have funds to cover that, we, of course, at this point, do not. Eventually, the homeowners are more than willing to pay for these repairs, but we need money up front to do them (and then we’ll add a little to the monthly payments to cover the cost).  So, if you’ve been thinking that this would be a good time to donate to the Habitat cause, let me assure you—it is!!  And while you’re pondering, enjoy some pictures from the Habitat archives:
