On February 20, 2022, Uni High returned to the Delta after a one-year
COVID-enforced hiatus, and CAFCH welcomed them with closed arms, ever-present
masks, and a serious commitment to social distancing—but we were still
overjoyed to have them return!  Because of ongoing health concerns and a
desire to avoid overcrowding without reducing the number of volunteers, the
group split itself into two, with one crew staying in the Clarksdale dorm
as usual and the other heading south 17 miles to Tutwiler, to work with our
sister affiliate, West Tallahatchie Habitat for Humanity.  And work they did!

The Tutwiler work, overseen by ace construction guru, JD Smith, consisted of
preparing a lot for its slab and then having that slab poured—a momentous
moment in all new home processes.  Enjoying balmy Delta weather after a long
cold winter in IL, the volunteers covered themselves with glory (and just a
little cement).  Unfortunately, there weren't quite enough work boots to
go around so our JD clone, Ben Williams, ended up with a bunch of it on his
sneaker-clad feet, which left him with some serious foot burns as he hobbled
through the rest of the week.

None of that stopped Ben, however, from overseeing some serious destruction
at the old Paramount theater in downtown Clarksdale.  A little background
on that work.  Because of the ongoing COVID slowdown and the exigencies of
Delta winter weather, we had not made as much progress as the Tutwilerites,
so we were still waiting on the slab prep for our 50th house and therefore
had little work for volunteers.  Such moments, though apparently unavoidable,
are nevertheless quite anxiety-producing, and this time was no exception.
In the gap, however, stepped Ben Lewis and our dear friends from Griot Arts,
another of the splendid afterschool non-profits that Clarksdale is becoming
known for.  They, it turned out, had just been given an abandoned four-story
former JC Penney building and a neighboring derelict site once the home of the
famous Paramount Theater, a Clarksdale landmark.  Griot was in the beginning
stages of securing major grants for the renovation of both buildings, in
order to transform it into an educational and performance space, the like
of which hasn't been seen in the Delta for some time.  Pre-transformation,
they needed demolition and clean-up—as it turns out, a lot of it—and
the Uni kids were absolutely up to the task!  Within the week (thanks to
the generosity of local friend, David Holt), several trailer loads of scrap
drywall, metal, wood, and accumulated dirt made its way to the local dump,
and, once again, all benefited tremendously from the kind of allied effort
for which CAFCH is becoming noted.

Being split into two groups, with little opportunity for group interaction
on the jobsites was truly unfortunate for the Uni-ites, but we were able
to make up for it by having our nightly group discussions (and birthday
celebrations) at Griot's Meraki Coffee Shop, thereby highlighting again the
symbiotic relationships developing among the Clarksdale non-profits. The
groups were also united by joining in one of the legendary potlucks put
on by local Habitat homeowners in Tutwiler.  Here, we got to see firsthand
again the generosity of the local community, as they fed us to overflowing.
We were also blessed with visits that night from Clarksdale pastor JJ Jackson,
always a crowd favorite, and JoAnn Blue, a recent addition to the Clarksdale
Fuller contingent, about whom we will be hearing more soon.

As always, the trip had a profound impact on the students and three of them
were willing to share their testimonials with CAFCH, for inclusion in this
news story.  Ryland Graham wrote:

We certainly hope not!

Sally Ma contributed her energy and cheerfulness to the demotion work in
Clarksdale and she took advantage of the proximity of some of the local
attractions to delve into the dynamics of blues culture, so central to the
Delta experience:

Madeleine Keenan spent most of her week in Tutwiler, and her reflections were

And CAFCH was honored to have all these remarkable students willing to
participate in the restorative work being done here in Clarksdale.
