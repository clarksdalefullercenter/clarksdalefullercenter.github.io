In 2022, we gratefully received a $10,000 "Crossing Divides" grant from
the Kindle Project, which called for "grassroots initiatives and local
organizations that are working with members of their community to resolve
conflict and make meaningful positive change in their hometowns, across
aisles and regardless of social differences... [and] to support groups
that are addressing root problems and are focused on healing political,
cultural, religious, civic, or other conflicts." In describing what they
considered to be a "successful outcome," the Project called for "giving
members of the community opportunities for common lived experience outside
their usual comfort zones and a greater sense of community solidarity,
as unity and dignity replaces distrust and division." Fostering such
opportunities lies at the heart of the CAFCH vision.

On 8 AM on Saturday morning, May 20, 2023, in a historic moment for
CAFCH, volunteers from King's Temple Missionary Baptist Church and First
Presbyterian Church, Clarksdale met to partner in the ongoing work at the new
house on Douglas St. in Riverton.  For the next 8 hours, some 20 volunteers
from the churches performed much-needed repairs on the west side of the
CAFCH dorm, provided deep cleaning of the dorm kitchen, and put siding and
roofing on the shed accompanying the under-construction home, CAFCH's 50th.
In addition, a crew of three high schoolers from the Beta Club at Clarksdale
High led by Raquel Wells-Williams, as well as Neal Mitchell from Metropolitan
Missionary Baptist Church, and Charles Lane from the Clarksdale Fire Department
made much-appreciated contributions.

The collaboration was the brainchild of pastors Mark Webb of KT (and former
assistant pastor at FPC) and Ryan Dean of FPC.  Coordinating the workday was
CAFCH Operations Coordinator Gramm Phillips and overseeing the actual work
was CAFCH Construction Supervisor Ben Williams, with excellent supervisory
support from Mack Williams III and Roosevelt Howard of KT and David Holt
and Pete Johnson of FPC.  But the real story of the day was the presence of
the unheralded volunteers who bravely put aside all hesitation to scale the
scaffolding for the roof work, manned (and womanned) the unfamiliar nail gun
to attach the siding, and cheerfully haul away debris from the two work sites.
At the end of the day (of perfect weather, despite forecasts to the contrary),
everyone expressed a genuine sense of accomplishment, both for the work itself
and for the Christian fellowship accompanying it. As one FPC volunteer put it,
"I've been involved in a lot of work projects around Clarksdale over the
years, but I've never seen a black church and a white church cooperating
together like this!"

Roughly 24 hours later, members of the churches reconvened for a potluck at
the lovely KT Charles Johnson Fellowship Hall.  KT cooks prepared the main
dishes and provided drinks, while FPC volunteers contributed desserts, and
their efforts were both exemplary and well-appreciated, as well as delicious!
Before sharing the meal, Pastor Mark Webb opened the festivities with prayer
and new homeowner Chrisheira Haynes and the architect of the 50th house John
Barnes were recognized.  When the eating was successfully and gratefully
completed, Pastor Ryan Dean presented a homily from the 133rd Psalm, which
begins with "How good and how pleasant it is when God's people dwell in
unity," before the entire group gathered outside for a picture.  It was
more than a fitting ending for a long-anticipated projectâ€”hopefully, the
first of many such collaborations between KT and FPC and a model for other
churches and civic organizations in Clarksdale.  Our sincere thanks go out
to all who planned, participated, and helped fund this wonderful occasion!
